### Five reasons Power BI Online governance fits perfectly with the SharePoint Online migration

1. **Unified security and identity model (one set of permissions, not two worlds)**  
   - Both SharePoint Online and Power BI Online use the same **Azure AD / M365 groups** and user identities.  
   - As you redesign sites, teams, and groups in SharePoint Online, you can align **Power BI workspaces and report access** with the same structure (departments, project teams, etc.).  
   - Result: less confusion, fewer “backdoor” permissions, and a single place to manage access for content *and* analytics.

2. **Consistent information architecture and data governance across M365**  
   - Migration to SharePoint Online usually includes:
     - Cleaning up sites, libraries, and permissions  
     - Defining where “official” documents and data live  
   - You can apply the **same governance patterns** to Power BI:
     - Official / certified datasets equivalent to “official” document libraries  
     - Workspaces mapped to the same business units and projects as SharePoint sites.  
   - Result: staff understand where to find **trusted documents and trusted reports** in a coherent, governed structure.

3. **Improved collaboration: reports live close to the content they explain**  
   - SharePoint Online is the collaboration hub; Power BI is the analytics layer.  
   - With governed Power BI Online:
     - You can embed reports directly into **SharePoint Online pages** (e.g., team site dashboards, project status pages, intranet home).  
     - Users see context, documents, and KPIs together, instead of jumping between on‑prem BI and cloud content.  
   - Result: better user adoption of both platforms and fewer “where do I find this?” questions.

4. **Centralised administration, monitoring, and support model**  
   - Your move to SharePoint Online already pushes you toward a **modern M365 admin model**.  
   - Folding Power BI Online into this:
     - Leverages the same admin centre patterns, incident management, and change control.  
     - Lets your IT team build a **single playbook** for provisioning, lifecycle management, and support across SharePoint + Power BI.  
   - Result: less operational overhead than running **separate on‑prem SharePoint and unmanaged BI**, and clearer accountability within IT.

5. **Future‑proof analytics and easier decommissioning of on‑prem**  
   - As you migrate content to SharePoint Online, you eventually want to **retire on‑prem SharePoint and legacy BI**.  
   - By governing Power BI Online now:
     - You create a modern cloud endpoint for analytics that aligns with the rest of your M365/cloud strategy.  
     - You simplify later decommissioning of on‑prem BI and related servers/gateways.  
   - Result: lower long‑term infrastructure cost, simpler architecture, and a cleaner path for future services (Fabric, advanced analytics, etc.).
