Checklist
Frame the problem: what’s wrong with the current “wild west” Power BI usage
Explain business risk: security, compliance, data privacy
Explain technical risk: performance, data quality, shadow IT
Explain value: better adoption, trust, and re‑use of data assets
Position IT’s role: what “governing and running Power BI Online” actually means
Tie to concrete outcomes: cost control, auditability, fewer incidents
Why IT should govern and run Power BI Online (vs today’s unmanaged state)
1. Security, privacy, and compliance

Know who has access to what data

Today: You “don’t know who does what, who has access, who is consuming it.”
With IT‑governed Power BI Online:
Centralised workspaces mapped to business units / projects
Azure AD / M365 groups controlling access
Row‑level security (RLS) and object‑level security enforced consistently

Control external and cross‑tenant sharing

Prevent accidental or uncontrolled sharing of sensitive reports outside the company.
Policies on who can share dashboards externally and how (e.g., guest access vs publish to web strictly blocked).

Meet regulatory and audit requirements

Power BI Online gives an audit trail (who published, viewed, exported, shared).
Easier to respond to audits and investigations (“who accessed this financial dataset in Q3?”).
2. Data quality and “one version of the truth”

Stop conflicting numbers in different reports

Today: Multiple people build their own reports, often against different extracts of the same data, leading to arguments about which numbers are correct.
With IT‑governed Online:
Certified / promoted datasets owned by IT or data owners (e.g., “Official Sales Model”).
Business users build reports on top of these trusted datasets instead of creating their own rogue data models.

Standardised KPIs and metrics

Define canonical measures (e.g., “Revenue”, “Gross Margin”, “Active Customer”) once, centrally.
Reduces time spent reconciling numbers across departments.
3. Reduced risk from shadow IT and ad‑hoc solutions

Eliminate unknown data flows

Today: Unknown Excel exports, personal data extracts, and one‑off Power BI files on desktops or file shares.
Centralised Online service:
Dataflows and datasets are visible and owned.
Less chance of sensitive extracts living on C: drives, USB sticks, or random SharePoint libraries.

Controlled use of gateways and data refresh

On‑premises data gateway managed by IT instead of each team hacking their own connectivity.
Prevents unsupported connections, broken refreshes, and inconsistent schedules.
4. Better visibility and monitoring

Know who is doing what and what is important

Power BI Online admin and usage metrics let you see:
Which reports and datasets are most used
Who is creating the most content
Which workspaces are stale or abandoned
Lets you clean up obsolete content and focus support on high‑value areas.

Proactive performance and capacity management

Monitor slow datasets, heavy queries, and refresh failures.
Plan capacity (Premium/PPU vs Pro) instead of firefighting slowness and outages.
5. Governance without killing self‑service

Structured self‑service instead of chaos

IT provides the “guardrails”: environments, workspaces, data sources, security, and standards.
Business users still build reports and dashboards, but:
In governed workspaces
From certified datasets
With naming conventions and lifecycle rules (Dev/Test/Prod).

Clear roles and responsibilities

IT: platform, security, data gateways, monitoring, standards.
Business: ownership of content and business logic, with designated “Power BI champions”.
Avoids the current situation where nobody is really accountable.
6. Cost control and licensing optimisation

Right‑size licenses and capacity

Today: You don’t know who is actually using Power BI or for what, so licenses are random and cost is opaque.
With governance:
Use usage data to identify heavy vs light users.
Decide where Pro, PPU, or Premium capacity makes sense.
Retire unused workspaces and accounts to save money.

Avoid duplication and waste

Multiple teams currently pulling the same data and building similar reports = duplicated effort and storage.
Central datasets and standardised reports reduce re‑work and infrastructure overhead.
7. Incident response and business continuity

Faster incident handling

When something breaks (bad data, missing report, refresh failure), IT has:
Line of sight to the dataset and gateway
Logs and diagnostics
You can fix root causes instead of guessing who built what where.

Ownership when people leave

Today: Reports tied to personal accounts become orphaned when people leave the company.
Under governance:
Content hosted in organisational workspaces, not personal workspaces.
Defined content owners and secondary owners reduces risk of critical reports disappearing.
8. Strategic alignment and value realisation

Align analytics with company priorities

IT can help ensure:
Key strategic dashboards are robust, secure, and visible to the right leadership.
Analytics roadmap lines up with major initiatives (e.g., new product, new region, compliance project).

Higher trust in data and decisions

Once execs know IT is governing access, data quality, and security, they’re more comfortable using Power BI outputs to make decisions.
This directly increases the perceived value of both IT and the data platform.
How to position this to leadership / stakeholders

You can summarise the above into a few punchy bullets for slides or an email:

Reduce risk: Central governance of Power BI Online gives us visibility into who can see what, how sensitive data is used, and a full audit trail.
Improve data trust: Certified datasets and central models ensure “one version of the truth” instead of conflicting spreadsheets and reports.
Control cost: Usage‑based insight into licenses and workspaces allows us to right‑size licensing and avoid wasted spend.
Support self‑service safely: Business teams keep flexibility to build their own reports, but within guardrails that protect the company.
Increase resilience: IT‑owned workspaces, gateways, and monitoring reduce outages, orphaned reports, and incident resolution time.
Validation / next steps

This directly addresses why IT should step in: you move from an opaque, risky, and inconsistent reporting landscape to a governed, auditable, and cost‑effective analytics platform.

If you’d like, I can help you craft:

A one‑pager or slide deck targeted at your CIO / data governance board, or
A concrete governance outline for Power BI Online (roles, policies, and a phased rollout plan) that fits your current on‑prem + Online hybrid reality.
